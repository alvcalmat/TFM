% Tutor del proyecto:
To my advisor, Jesús, for guiding me in this project, for trusting in me to join the research group to which he belongs, for supporting me in my decision to join a doctoral program, for always seeking the best for us despite his preferences and for his kindness. 

% Compañeros del departamento
To all those department colleagues who have helped me every time I have needed it and all those who have ever volunteered to support me. In particular, I would like to thank Fran and Arturo for all the time they have dedicated to helping me out. 

To Damián, for accompanying me in the easy and difficult moments, but above all, for being my friend, and for being there unconditionally for whatever I needed. 

% Compañeros de clase, por acompañarde durante todo el camino
To my classmates, who despite being a difficult year with social distancing, have been as close as ever.

% Amigos
To all my friends, for being such good friends. 

% La familia
To my entire family, for their unconditional love and support, and for their patience and understanding.
