\chapter{Problem Formulation}
\label{ch:ProblemFormulation}
\lettrine[lraise=-0.1, lines=2, loversize=0.2]{A}{s} mentioned in the chapter \ref{ch:Introduction}, the context around which this cognitive task planner is being developed is the inspection and maintenance of electrical networks. Although one of the objectives is to build a task planner whose characteristics allow its easy reuse and adaptation for other applications, it is relevant to state the problem for which it is being originally prepared. 

The AERIAL-CORE project (H2020-ICT-2019-871479) aims to develop different technologies for the use of multi-\gls{UAV} equipment in inspection and maintenance tasks in high-voltage electrical installations. In particular, one of the technologies proposed is the use of \glspl{ACW}, i.e. small teams of cooperative \glspl{UAV} to safely support maintenance workers while working at height on power lines. These systems would have to interact with humans (see Fig. \ref{fig:aerial_co_worker}) to inspect certain parts that are indicated to them, monitor worker safety during operation and deliver tools or other light equipment, in order to make the work more efficient and safer. In addition, to have a greater impact, the system would need to operate over extended periods of time, being able to autonomously deal with certain faults or recharges.

\end{figure}

Three types of \glspl{ACW} are referred, each intended to provide different functionality: \textit{Inspection-ACW}, \textit{Safety-ACW}, and \textit{Physical-ACW}. The use case scenarios can be summarized as follows: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Inspection}, where a fleet of \glspl{ACW} (i.e., \textit{Inspection-ACWs}) carries out a detailed investigation of power equipment autonomously, helping the human workers to acquire views of the power tower that are not easily accessible (see Fig. \ref{fig:inspection_task});
    \item \textit{Safety}, where a formation of \glspl{ACW} (i.e., \textit{Safety-ACWs}) provides the supervising team with a view of the humans working on the power tower in order to monitor their status and to ensure their safety (see Fig. \ref{fig:monitor_task});
    \item \textit{Physical}, where an \gls{ACW} (i.e., \textit{Physical-ACW}) physically interacts with the human worker and provides physical assistance to it, i.e., while in contact with the human it flies stably, reliably, and accomplishes the required physical task (e.g., handover of a tool) without becoming harmful for the human worker (see Fig. \ref{fig:deliver_task}).
\end{itemize} 

Even if there is a specific type of \gls{ACW} for each of the tasks (inspection, monitoring and tool delivery), this does not mean that a \gls{UAV} can at any given time undertake a task for which it is not the best. It will therefore be the planner's task to take into account which \glspl{ACW} are best suited for each task, which are not but could perform it without problem, and which do not have the capacity to perform it at all. As a consequence, the number of ways in which the mission planning can be carried out multiplies, thus considerably increasing the difficulty of the problem that the task planner has to solve.

This mission planning problem with multiple \glspl{UAV} with battery constraints can be posed as an optimization problem, the solution of which indicates the most efficient way to allocate the different tasks and plan recharges. To react to possible failures, one of the most widespread options is to come up with dynamic methods that can replan in real time as certain events occur. Although there are many variants, most formulations for missions where multiple vehicles visit multiple locations to inspect or make deliveries give rise to NP-hard optimization problems and, therefore, the most widespread approach is to solve them using heuristic algorithms.

Uncertainty planning methods are appropriate for adding cognitive capabilities to a system that has to interact with humans in dynamic environments, as they allow optimizing plans by predicting the most likely intentions of humans and the outcomes of future actions. The main problem is their computational complexity, as the plan search space would grow exponentially with the number of \glspl{UAV} and with the future time horizon over which planning is to take place.

It is in this context and with these ideas in mind that the cognitive task planner was developed. As this is one of the software layers that make up the architecture that solve the problem, in order to present the details on which the planner has been designed it is necessary to at least talk about what information exchanges exist between the upper and lower layers of the software architecture, describe the interfaces by which this information travels and highlight when control is passed to lower levels of the software architecture. In the following section this information is presented by individually explaining the different tasks contemplated in the project. 

On the other hand, a review will be made of other important considerations that the planner must take into account such as battery recharges, connection losses and task rescheduling; analyzing the different situations in which each of them can occur and their different causes.
